### Description

Learn to manage parameters with Python.


### Level 1

- Exercise 1: 
  - Grab a sports-themed dataset that you like and normalize categorical attributes in dummy. Normalize numeric attributes with StandardScaler.
  
### Level 2

- Exercise 2: 
  - Continue with the sports theme data set you like and apply the main component analysis.

### Level 3

- Exercise 3: 
  - Continue with the sports theme data set you like and normalize the data taking into account the outliers.


### Targets

- Pre-process the data by performing feature engineering
- Interpret the different concepts of feature engineering
